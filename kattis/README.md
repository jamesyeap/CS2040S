# Important Points
- Include your `name` and `student number` in comments at the top of your code.
- Include the names of collaborators in comments at the top of your code.

### 6 main constructs 
SEQUENCE represents linear tasks sequentially performed one after the other.
WHILE a loop with a condition at its beginning.
REPEAT-UNTIL a loop with a condition at the bottom.
FOR another way of looping.
IF-THEN-ELSE a conditional statement changing the flow of the algorithm.
CASE the generalization form of IF-THEN-ELSE.

## 2 other constructs
Invoking classes or calling functions (using the CALL keyword).
Handling exceptions (using EXCEPTION, WHEN keywords).

## It is (usually) ok to do everything in the `main()` class
Don't need to model the problem statement using OOP
- Restaurant, Menu class etc not required! 

More concerned about correctness and runtime complexity.

## Misc
- Sometimes the Problem-Intro can contain hints.

# Lab Structure 
## [Part 1] Short Lesson
- max 30 mins
- discuss solution to past week's problem
- brief for this week's problem
	- discuss relevant Java API for current 

## [Part 2] Write Pseudocode Solution
- around 20-30 mins long
### Important
- your attendance will only be marked AFTER you have verified your pseudocode with TA

# Compiling Java Code
```bash
javac Echo.java # must have .java extension
```
# Testing
## Input
```bash
java Echo < Hello.txt
```
## Saving Output
```bash
java Echo > Bye.txt
```
## Do both together

## Try compiling AND testing together
```bash
java Echo.java # compile + run? dont need java?
```
